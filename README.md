# üç¨ Dashboard App

## Overview

Using React, this repo seeks to build a dashboard app with basic security. This is a first attempt at using React with a major focus on data visualisation and general web app features. There is room to design some API for scraping data from an online platform and this could be useful for measuring personal metrics across different popular services with API access e.g. Spotify. As a first webpage and with focus towards deploying a dashboard utility, Bootstrap will be used as the main tool for component design over something like Tailwind since there is no prior experience shared there.

## Usage
